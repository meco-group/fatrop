Getting Started
===============

This guide will help you get started with Fatrop, a fast trajectory optimization package.

Different Interfaces
--------------------

Fatrop offers two main interfaces:

1. Low-level Interface
----------------------

The low-level interface is suitable for:

- Power users who want to implement overhead-less function evaluation
- Users who want to interface their own framework
- Implementing custom Jacobians and Hessians

Dependencies: BLASFEO and stdc++

For examples, refer to the C++ examples in the `examples` directory.

2. CasADi Interface
-------------------

The CasADi interface is recommended for most users, offering:

- Easy-to-use symbolic manipulation
- State-of-the-art automatic differentiation
- Access to different solvers besides fatrop

This interface is recommended for most users.
Refer to the examples and cookbook for usage.

Next Steps
----------

- Explore the `examples` directory for more detailed examples
- Read the API Reference for in-depth information on Fatrop's classes and methods
- Experiment with your own optimization problems using both interfaces
- Read the `fatrop CasADi cookbook`
